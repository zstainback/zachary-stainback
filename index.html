            <h1><strong>Welcome!</strong></h1>
            <p>I'm Zach Stainback, and I am interested in almost everything. This website started as a project when I was exploring my interest in coding and web development.
                Since then, the website has gone in several different directions. Since starting my college education at Brigham Young University in January 2017, I have completed
                coursework in Political Science, Computer Science, and Marriage and Family Studies. Ultimately, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Marriage and Family Studies 
                from BYU-Idaho in December 2023, after which I promptly decided to pursue a career in business. I worked in retail all through my college experience, and I had several
                years of experience as an assistant manager before completing my degree. When I decided that a career in counseling or family life education no longer interested me, 
                business seemed like a natural choice. I could always go for an MBA, right? This would by a potentially lucrative next step given my work experience. I decided to use my 
                admittedly limited web development skills to create a personal website, which I hoped would one day serve as a platform my new North Carolina-based business persona: the
                rural businessman. I've since found that management just doesn't ignite my passion for work the way I'd hoped. I still had this domain name and website, so I set to figuring
                 out what to do with it. This is the result: a conglomeration of my thoughts, ideas, beliefs, and passions. Thank you for joining me on my educational and professoinal journey
                Welcome to my own personal soapbox.

                I grew up in a small town in eastern North Carolina. This rural setting contributed so much
                to the way I now view the world, and ultimately, it was likely the tight&hyphen;knit community
                in which I grew up that enabled me to overcome the odds and create a successful life for myself
                and my family. My father passed away when I was young, and for the rest of my childhood, it was
                just my mom and me. My community, especially the community I found at church, was incredibly 
                important to my social and cognitive development. I was homeschooled, and the friends I made at
                church, in Scouting, and in other extracurricular activities were instrumental in creating my worldview.
                The leaders I found in these activities and organizations were just as important, and many of them
                remain influential in my life to this day. None of this could make up for the loss of my father, but 
                I retained sufficient memories of him to help me indepently set a direction for my life.

                For many years, I was primarily interested in social science. Politics captivated me 
                in high school, and after spending two-years as a volunteer missionary for the Church of
                Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I began my university studies as a Political Science major
                at Brigham Young University in January of 2017. I quickly discovered that this was not where I 
                wanted to be or what I wanted to be doing. After taking some time away to work, save money and
                &ldquo;find myself,&rdquo; I made the decision to transfer to Brigham Young University-Idaho 
                as an online student majoring in Marriage and Family Studies. I felt this major offered an
                opportunity to channel my interest in social science into something meaningful.

                While pursuing this degree, I met and married my sweetheart, Rylee. Within about three years,
                we were the parents of two children and a spunky German Sheprador named Sadie. It was a busy, 
                wonderful, chaotic, amazing time. I was coming to the end of my degree program, and I was still working
                in the same industry that I'd started in while studying at BYU: grocery. I'd been a grocery assistant
                manager for nearly seven years, and while my earnings were steadily increasing, the rapid inflation 
                following the COVID&hyphen;19 pandemic and the relatively low wages available in the grocery business
                made it difficult to support my growing family.

                In the summer before the final semester of my undergraduate program, I found myself facing a difficult decision 
                about the future of my education. One option involved transfering again, losing two thirds of my credits, and 
                beginning a course of study with a greater ROI. &lpar;It was during this time that I began to study coding and 
                web devleopment.&rpar; For obvious reasons, this course was not ideal. Another option involved sticking to my 
                original plan of becoming a counselor, finishing my undergraduate degree at BYU-Idaho, and seeking admittance 
                to a graduate degree program in Marriage and Family Therapy. By this time, I was disillusioned with the field 
                of marriage and family therapy, and while my education was a boon to my young family, I no longer had a passion 
                for applying this knowledge to my professional pursuits. After much consideration and a lot of prayer, I made the 
                decision to begin an agressive pursuit of a business career, beginning with a move back across the country to North 
                Carolina. I knew there was opportunity to grow with my previous company there, so my family and I packed up and 
                returned to my old hometown. I finished my four&hyphen;year degree in Marriage and Family Studies and prepared to 
                seek admittance to an MBA program. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I eventually got the promotion I hoped for when moving to North Carolina, and I have been managing a Piggly Wiggly
                grocery store for a little over a year. It was at this point that I decided to shift my educational focus away from
                career progression and onto personal enrichment and development. To that end, I researched various programs and decided 
                to work toward admittance to the online ALM program through the Harvard Extension School. I am presently waiting on the
                results from my first attempt at the Test of Critical Reading and Writing Skills, which will determine the admittance course 
                in which I will enroll first. I am looking forward to documenting my experience in this new and exciting chapter.
