            <p>Thank you for visiting my website. My hope is to portray myself and my story
                accurately so others can come to know me better and understand how the skills,
                abilities, and perspectives I bring can augment the quality of their projects. 
                In addition to my personal and professional interest in technology, I also
                enjoy many other hobbies and passions, some of which I mention below to provide
                a more complete picture of who I am and how I think. Pleased to meet you, I'm Zach.

                I grew up in a small town in eastern North Carolina. I was exposed to technology from
                an early age. My father worked for Dupont for many years before his role was outsourced
                to Computer Science Corporation &lpar;CSC&rpar;. Some of my earliest memories of
                using technology involve AOL instant messenging my dad while he was at work. My father's
                career helped me learn about the technology of the day and become familiar with its use. 
                Unfortunately, he passed away when I was just eight years old, leaving me with a rudimentary
                understanding of what technology, especially computers, could do and limiting my knowledge of
                where technology was poised to go in the future.

                For many years after, I was primarily interested in social science. Politics captivated me 
                in high school, and after spending two-years as a volunteer missionary for the Church of
                Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I began my university studies as a Political Science major
                at Brigham Young University in January of 2017. I quickly discovered that this was not where I 
                wanted to be or what I wanted to be doing. After taking some time away to work, save money and
                &ldquo;find myself,&rdquo; I made the decision to transfer to Brigham Young University-Idaho 
                as an online student majoring in Marriage and Family Studies. I felt this major offered an
                opportunity to channel my interest in social science into something meaningful. Societies problems,
                I believed, were better solved in the home than in the Capitol.

                While pursuing this degree, I met and married my sweetheart, Rylee. Within about three years,
                we were the parents of two children and a spunky German Sheprador named Sadie. It was a busy, 
                wonderful, chaotic, amazing time. I was coming to the end of my degree program, and I was still working
                in the same industry that I'd started in while studying at BYU: grocery. I'd been a grocery assistant
                manager for nearly seven years, and while my earnings were steadily increasing, the rapid inflation 
                following the COVID-19 pandemic and the relatively low wages available in the grocery business
                made it difficult to support my growing family. Realizing that I would also need to spend additional
                time and money pursuing a graduate degree in order to improve my family's financial situation,
                I made the difficult decision to transfer schools and, again, change majors. This time, I would be 
                studying Computer Science at Western Governors University. I began taking the prerequisite classes
                and studying some other materials to familiarize myself with concepts related to this field, earning my 
                first AWS certification along the way. I gradually came to realize that this field offered such a depth of 
                opportunity, challenge, and potential to be the provider that I always wanted to be. After many years, 
                I found a course of study and career path that combined my passion for family, especially my own, with 
                daily activities that kept me captivated and engaged in my work. This website is the product of my new
                direction, and I am excited to create this record of my experiences and growth as I begin my studies.

            <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Music</li>
                    <p>I started taking piano lessons when I was just six years old. I've been privileged to use that ability
                        throughout my life in various settings. Along the way, I also added proficiency in organ and guitar. 
                        A couple of the highlights of my musical experience are playing the famed organ in the Tabernacle of
                        the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City, Utah with part-time Tabernacle Choir
                        organist Andrew Undsworth and sharing the stage with Eddy Long, who has played guitar for such acts as 
                        Blake Shelton and David Allan Coe. 
                    </p>
                <li>Hiking&sol;Fishing</li>
                    <p>I took up outdoor activities during one of my life's more turbulent times. I'd moved back to North Carolina
                        after dropping out of college, leaving a job I really enjoyed, and a breakup that left my confidence shattered.
                        Hiking and fishing became an outlet for me&#8212;a way to channel the frustration, anger, sadness I was 
                        experiencing after watching my plans fall apart. Being surrounded by nature was freeing, and even the long 
                        drives in my pickup to reach my chosen trails or fishing holes became almost therapeutic for me. I grew to 
                        love exploring new places or the challenge enticing fish to bite. After moving back to North Carolina, I set
                        a goal to visit every North Carolina State Park before my thirtieth birthday. Since moving to southern Utah,
                        I don't know that I'll reach that goal, but I'm still going to try!
                    </p>
                <li>Photography</li>
                    <p>My interest in photography grew out of my developing love of hiking. I wanted to document my adventures
                        and have some way to remember the amazing places I'd visited and vistas I'd seen. All of the images you find
                        on my website, with the exception of photos that include me, were taken by yours truly. I was fortunate to 
                        have some foundational knowledge of photography from experiences in Scouting and other activities in which
                        I'd participated in my youth. While this will only ever be a hobby for me, it is a skillset that I plan to develop
                        further as I continue to seek out new places to explore with my family.
                    </p>
                <li>Genealogy</li>
                    <p>My interest in genealogy comes in part from my religious beliefs, but while faith motivated me to begin researching
                        my family, I was soon so enthralled with my family's history that I needed no incentive to keep going. My 5th great
                        grandfather, for example, was a participant in the regulator rebellion of western North Carolina in the late 1760s,
                        a predecessor to the American Revolution. Another ancestor and personal acquaintance of George Washington, Starling Gunn,
                        was honored when soil from his grave was used to plant a tree near Washington's tomb at Mt. Vernon. Starling had been 
                        at the Battle of Yorktown and was eyewitness to the surrender of General Cornwallis to Washington. It is amazing what
                        you can find, and even more amazing are the connections that come as you meet distant relatives who quickly become friends.
