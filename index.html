            <p>I'm Zach Stainback. I've designed this website to be my virtual home on the internet&mdash;as well as a personal web
                development playground&mdash;where I can present myself professionally in greater detail. You won't find much about 
                my work history here. Instead, I've chosent to present a holistic view of my professional life and interests. There 
                is more to a person than their r&eacute;sum&eacute;. The places we visit, the activities we enjoy, the classes we take,
                the books we read, and viritually everything we do makes an impact on our professional capacities and aptitudes. It is
                my aim to demonstrate how the way I conduct myself outside of work positively affects my ability to lead in the workplace.

                I grew up in a small town in eastern North Carolina. This rural setting contributed so much
                to the way I now view the world, and ultimately, it was likely the tight&ndash;knit community
                in which I grew up that enabled me to overcome the odds and create a successful life for myself
                and my family. My father passed away when I was young, and for the rest of my childhood, it was
                just my mom and me. My community, especially the community I found at church, was incredibly 
                important to my social and cognitive development. I was homeschooled, and the friends I made at
                church, in Scouting, and in other extracurricular activities were instrumental in creating my worldview.
                The leaders I found in these activities and organizations were just as important, and many of them
                remain influential in my life to this day. None of this could make up for the loss of my father, but 
                I retained sufficient memories of him to help me indepently set a direction for my life.

                For many years, I was primarily interested in social science. Politics captivated me 
                in high school, and after spending two-years as a volunteer missionary for the Church of
                Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I began my university studies as a Political Science major
                at Brigham Young University in January of 2017. I quickly discovered that this was not where I 
                wanted to be or what I wanted to be doing. After taking some time away to work, save money and
                &ldquo;find myself,&rdquo; I made the decision to transfer to Brigham Young University-Idaho 
                as an online student majoring in Marriage and Family Studies. I felt this major offered an
                opportunity to channel my interest in social science into something meaningful. Societies problems,
                I believed, were better solved in the home than in the Capitol.

                While pursuing this degree, I met and married my sweetheart, Rylee. Within about three years,
                we were the parents of two children and a spunky German Sheprador named Sadie. It was a busy, 
                wonderful, chaotic, amazing time. I was coming to the end of my degree program, and I was still working
                in the same industry that I'd started in while studying at BYU: grocery. I'd been a grocery assistant
                manager for nearly seven years, and while my earnings were steadily increasing, the rapid inflation 
                following the COVID-19 pandemic and the relatively low wages available in the grocery business
                made it difficult to support my growing family.

                In the summer before the final semester of my undergraduate program, I found myself facing a difficult decision 
                about the future of my education. One option involved transfering again, losing two thirds of my credits, and 
                beginning a course of study with a greater ROI. &lpar;It was during this time that I began to study coding and 
                web devleopment.&rpar; For obvious reasons, this course was not ideal. Another option involved sticking to my 
                original plan of becoming a counselor, finishing my undergraduate degree at BYU-Idaho, and seeking admittance 
                to a graduate degree program in Marriage and Family Therapy. By this time, I was disillusioned with the field 
                of marriage and family therapy, and while my education was a boon to my young family, I no longer had a passion 
                for applying this knowledge to my professional pursuits. After much consideration and a lot of prayer, I made the 
                decision to begin an agressive pursuit of a business career, beginning with a move back across the country to North 
                Carolina. I knew there was opportunity to grow with my previous company there, so my family and I packed up and 
                returned to my old hometown. I finished my four&ndash;year degree in Marriage and Family Studies and prepared to 
                seek admittance to a good regional MBA program.

            <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Music</li>
                    <p>I started taking piano lessons when I was just six years old. I've been privileged to use that ability
                        throughout my life in various settings. Along the way, I also added proficiency in organ and guitar. 
                        A couple of the highlights of my musical experience are playing the famed organ in the Tabernacle of
                        the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City, Utah with part-time Tabernacle Choir
                        organist Andrew Undsworth and sharing the stage with Eddy Long, who has played guitar for such acts as 
                        Blake Shelton and David Allan Coe. 
                    </p>
                <li>Hiking&sol;Fishing</li>
                    <p>I took up outdoor activities during one of my life's more turbulent times. I'd moved back to North Carolina
                        after dropping out of college, leaving a job I really enjoyed, and a breakup that left my confidence shattered.
                        Hiking and fishing became an outlet for me&#8212;a way to channel the frustration, anger, sadness I was 
                        experiencing after watching my plans fall apart. Being surrounded by nature was freeing, and even the long 
                        drives in my pickup to reach my chosen trails or fishing holes became almost therapeutic for me. I grew to 
                        love exploring new places or the challenge enticing fish to bite. After moving back to North Carolina, I set
                        a goal to visit every North Carolina State Park before my thirtieth birthday. Since moving to southern Utah,
                        I don't know that I'll reach that goal, but I'm still going to try!
                    </p>
                <li>Photography</li>
                    <p>My interest in photography grew out of my developing love of hiking. I wanted to document my adventures
                        and have some way to remember the amazing places I'd visited and vistas I'd seen. All of the images you find
                        on my website, with the exception of photos that include me, were taken by yours truly. I was fortunate to 
                        have some foundational knowledge of photography from experiences in Scouting and other activities in which
                        I'd participated in my youth. While this will only ever be a hobby for me, it is a skillset that I plan to develop
                        further as I continue to seek out new places to explore with my family.
                    </p>
                <li>Genealogy</li>
                    <p>My interest in genealogy comes in part from my religious beliefs, but while faith motivated me to begin researching
                        my family, I was soon so enthralled with my family's history that I needed no incentive to keep going. My 5th great
                        grandfather, for example, was a participant in the regulator rebellion of western North Carolina in the late 1760s,
                        a predecessor to the American Revolution. Another ancestor and personal acquaintance of George Washington, Starling Gunn,
                        was honored when soil from his grave was used to plant a tree near Washington's tomb at Mt. Vernon. Starling had been 
                        at the Battle of Yorktown and was eyewitness to the surrender of General Cornwallis to Washington. It is amazing what
                        you can find, and even more amazing are the connections that come as you meet distant relatives who quickly become friends.
