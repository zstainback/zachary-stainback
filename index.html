            <h1><strong>Welcome!</strong></h1>
            <p>Thank you for visiting my website. My hope is to portray myself and my story
                accurately so others can come to know me better and understand how the skills,
                abilities, and perspectives I bring can augment the quality of their projects. 
                In addition to my personal and professional interest in technology, I also
                enjoy many other hobbies and passions, some of which I mention below to provide
                a more complete picture of who I am and how I think. Pleased to meet you, I'm Zach.

                I grew up in a small town in eastern North Carolina. I was exposed to technology from
                an early age. My father worked for Dupont for many years before his role was outsourced
                to Computer Science Corporation &lpar;CSC&rpar;. Some of my earliest memories of
                using technology involve AOL instant messenging my dad while he was at work. Unfortunately,
                my father passed away when I was eight years old after several years of battling cancer,
                and my exposure to technology reduced significantly.

                For many years after, I was primarily interested in social science. Politics captivated me 
                in high school, and after spending two-years as a volunteer missionary for the Church of
                Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I began my university studies as a Political Science major
                at Brigham Young University in January of 2017. I quickly discovered that this was not where I 
                wanted to be or what I wanted to be doing. After taking some time away to work, save money and
                &ldquo;find myself,&rdquo; I made the decision to transfer to Brigham Young University-Idaho 
                as an online student majoring in Marriage and Family Studies. I felt this major offered an
                opportunity to channel my interest in social science into something meaningful. Societies problems,
                I believed, were better solved in the home than in the Capitol.

                While pursuing this degree, I met and married my sweetheart, Rylee. Within about three years,
                we were the parents of two children and a spunky German Sheprador named Sadie. It was a busy, 
                wonderful, chaotic, amazing time. I was coming to the end of my degree program, and I was still working
                in the same industry that I'd started in while studying at BYU: grocery. I'd been a grocery assistant
                manager for nearly seven years, and while my earnings were steadily increasing, the rapid inflation 
                following the COVID-19 pandemic and the relatively low wages available in the grocery business
                made it difficult to support my growing family. Realizing that I would also need to spend additional
                time and money pursuing a graduate degree in order to improve my family's financial situation,
                I made the difficult decision to transfer schools and, again, change majors. This time, I would be 
                studying Computer Science at Western Governors University. I began taking the prerequisite classes
                and studying some other materials to familiarize myself with concepts related to this field, earning my 
                first AWS certification along the way. I gradually
                came to realize that this field offered such a depth of opportunity, challenge, and potential to be the 
                provider that I always wanted to be. After many years, I found a course of study and career path that combined
                my passion for family, especially my own, with daily activities that kept me captivated and engaged in 
                my work. This website is the product of that experience, and I am excited to create this record of my
                experiences and growth as I begin my studies.
